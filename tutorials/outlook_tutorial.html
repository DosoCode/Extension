                <li>If you don't have a Microsoft account, click "Create free account." You'll be asked to choose an email address (you can create one ending in @outlook.com or @hotmail.com).</li>

        <h3 id="OutlookInterface">The Outlook Interface</h3>
        <p>
            Once logged in, Outlook will display your inbox in the center, a sidebar on the left with folders like Inbox, Sent, Drafts, and Junk, and a toolbar at the top. The top includes search, settings, and a "New mail" button. The right side may show a calendar or task list if enabled.
            
            Outlook also includes Focused and Other tabs to help prioritize important emails. Focused Inbox shows what Outlook thinks are important messages, while Other shows the rest.
        </p>

        <h3 id="ComposeEmail">How to write an Email</h3>
        <p>
            Click the "New mail" button in the top left corner. A message panel will open on the right side of the screen. Type the recipient's email in the "To" field, add a subject, and type your message in the large space below. Click "Send" when you're finished.

        <h3 id="AttachFiles">How to attach files</h3>
        <p>
            While writing an email, click the paperclip icon (Attach) at the bottom of the compose window. Choose files from your device or from OneDrive. Once the file is uploaded, click "Send."
        </p>

        <h3 id="ReplyEmail">Replying to emails</h3>
        <p>
            Open the email you want to reply to. Click "Reply" to respond to the sender, or "Reply all" to include everyone on the email. Use "Forward" if you want to send the message to someone else. After writing your message, click "Send."
        </p>

        <h3 id="organization">Organizing your inbox</h3>
        <p>
            Outlook lets you move emails into folders, flag messages for follow-up, and mark emails as read or unread. You can also use "Sweep" to clean up unwanted emails or set up rules to sort incoming mail automatically.

        <h3 id="Settings">Settings and Customization</h3>
        <p>
            Click the gear icon in the upper right and select "View all Outlook settings" to customize how Outlook works. You can change the theme, add an email signature, enable dark mode, and manage your layout. Try different settings to find what works best for you.
        </p>

        <h3 id="Security">Security and Privacy</h3>
        <p>
            To keep your Outlook account secure, regularly update your password and set up two-step verification. Visit <a href="https://account.microsoft.com/security">Microsoft Account Security</a> to manage these options. Outlook also has built-in spam filtering and phishing protection.
        </p>

        <h3 id="ExtraStuff">Extra Stuff</h3>
<p>
    This section includes some helpful extras and lesser-known Outlook features you might find useful:
</p>
<ul>
    <li><strong>Using the Calendar:</strong> Outlook includes a built-in calendar. You can schedule events, set reminders, and send invites to others. Just click the calendar icon on the left side of the screen to get started.</li>
    
    <li><strong>Tasks and To-Dos:</strong> You can use the "To Do" panel to create a simple task list. Mark off items as you complete them. This is great for keeping track of what you need to do.</li>
    
    <li><strong>Search Tips:</strong> Use the search bar at the top of the screen to find emails quickly. You can type a name, subject, or even a phrase from the email. Outlook will filter and show matches.</li>
    
    <li><strong>Dark Mode:</strong> If you prefer a darker screen that's easier on the eyes, go to Settings (gear icon) > Theme and choose "Dark mode."</li>
    
    <li><strong>Undo Send:</strong> Accidentally sent an email too quickly? Outlook has an “Undo Send” option that lets you cancel sending for a few seconds after you press "Send."" You can enable or adjust this in Settings.</li>
    
    <li><strong>Mobile App:</strong> You can use Outlook on your phone or tablet. Just download the Outlook app from the App Store or Google Play and sign in with your account.</li>
    
    <li><strong>Outlook for Desktop:</strong> If you prefer using Outlook as a program on your computer, Microsoft offers a desktop version as part of Microsoft 365. It looks a bit different but works similarly.</li>
    
    <li><strong>Keyboard Shortcuts:</strong> For faster navigation, try using keyboard shortcuts. For example, press <code>Ctrl + N</code> to start a new email, or <code>Ctrl + Enter</code> to send it. You can view or change shortcuts in Settings.</li>
</ul>
