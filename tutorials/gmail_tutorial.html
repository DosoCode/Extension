        <p>Once you're signed in, the Gmail interface will display your inbox in the center, a left-hand sidebar, and a toolbar at the top. The inbox is where all incoming and read messages are stored. The sidebar gives access to other folders like Sent, Drafts, Spam, Trash, and any custom labels you’ve created. At the top, you’ll find the search bar, which lets you look up emails quickly, and the Compose button, which opens a new window to write an email. You’ll also find a gear icon for settings and layout options.
        
        Gmail often organizes emails into tabs such as Primary (important or personal messages), Social (updates from social networks), and Promotions (marketing emails). You can customize which tabs are visible. </p>


        <h3 id="ComposeEmail">How to write an Email</h3>
        <p>In the top-left corner of the website, you will see a button that says 'compose'. Press this buton to bring up a 'New Message' box on your screen. This is your email draft. The first line from the top has 'To' written on it. This is where you input who you are sending the email to. You will need their email address. If you dont send an email it will be stored in your Drafts until you've deleted it.</p>
